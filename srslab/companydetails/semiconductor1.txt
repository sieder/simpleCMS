Semiconductor surge arrester type 3 Littelfuse

Asymmetrical Modified MS-013 Balanced Three-chip SIDACtor® Device This balanced protector is a surface mount alternative to the modified TO-220 package. Based on a six-pin surface mount SOIC package, it uses Littelfuse's patented "Y" (US Patent 4,905,119) configuration. It is available in surge current ratings up to 500A. 

SIDACtor devices are used to enable equipment to meet various regulatory requirements including GR 1089, ITU K.20, K.21, and K.45, IEC 60950, UL 60950, and TIA-968 (formerly known as FCC Part 68). 

Notes: 
All measurements are made at an ambient temperature of 25°C. Ipp applies to -40°C through +85°C temperature range. 
Ipp is a repetitive surge rating and is guaranteed for the life of the product. 
Listed SIDACtor® devices are bi-directional. All electrical parameters & surge ratings apply to forward and reverse polarities. 
Vdrm is measured at Idrm. 
Vs is measured at 100 V/µs. 
Special voltage (Vs & Vdrm) and holding current (Ih) requirements are available upon request. 
Off-state capacitance is measured between Pins 1-3 and 1-4 at 1 MHz with a 2 V bias. 
Designed to meet balance requirements of GTS 8700 and GR 974.
